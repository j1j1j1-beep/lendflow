- Allowed servicers to review borrowers for individual loss mitigation options (rather than all at once)
- Required language access for loss mitigation communications
- Modified foreclosure procedural safeguards
- Added credit reporting protections during loss mitigation review

2. FinCEN transmits a "314(a) request" to financial institutions (typically every two weeks).
3. **Search obligation:** Upon receiving a 314(a) request, bank must expeditiously search its records to determine whether it maintains or has maintained any account for, or has engaged in any transaction with, the named subjects.
4. **Search scope:** Current accounts AND accounts maintained in the preceding 12 months. Must also search transactions within the last 6 months.
5. **Response deadline:** Positive matches must be reported to FinCEN within **14 days** of the request date.
6. **Record retention:** Must maintain records of 314(a) searches for **5 years**.

**Documents to Generate:**
- 314(a) Search Results Log

1. **Customer Identification Program (CIP):** Verify the identity of each customer opening an account (name, date of birth, address, identification number). (31 CFR 1020.220)
2. **Beneficial Ownership:** Identify and verify each natural person who owns 25% or more of a legal entity customer, and each individual with significant management responsibility. (31 CFR 1010.230(b))
3. **Understanding the Nature and Purpose of Customer Relationships:** Develop a customer risk profile. (31 CFR 1010.230(a))
4. **Ongoing Monitoring:** Conduct ongoing monitoring to identify and report suspicious transactions and, on a risk basis, maintain and update customer information. (31 CFR 1010.230(a))

**Legal Entity Customer Definition (1010.230(e)(1)):**
- Corporation, LLC, or other entity created by filing with a Secretary of State or similar office
- General partnership
- Similar foreign entity
- **Excludes:** sole proprietorships, unincorporated associations, natural persons opening individual accounts

**Beneficial Ownership Identification (1010.230(b)(1)-(2)):**
- Each individual who directly or indirectly owns **25% or more** equity interest
- If a trust owns 25%+, the trustee is the beneficial owner
- **One individual** with significant responsibility for managing the entity (e.g., CEO, CFO, managing member, general partner)
- Financial institution must collect: name, date of birth, address, SSN/TIN (or passport number for non-U.S. persons)

**Verification:** Must verify identity using risk-based procedures containing at minimum the same elements as CIP. (1010.230(b)(3))

**Timing:** Must be collected at account opening.

**Record Retention:** CDD records must be retained for **5 years** after the account is closed.

**Documents to Generate:**
- Beneficial Ownership Certification Form (FinCEN standard form or equivalent)
- CIP Verification Worksheet
- Customer Risk Assessment / Risk Rating Form
- Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) Report (for higher-risk customers)

## 2.6 Beneficial Ownership -- Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) Status

### 2.6.1 Current Status (as of February 2026)

**Major Change -- March 2025 Interim Final Rule:**

On March 21, 2025, FinCEN issued an interim final rule (published March 26, 2025) that **removed the BOI reporting requirement for all U.S. companies and U.S. persons.**

**What Changed:**
- "Reporting company" definition revised to mean ONLY entities formed under the law of a foreign country that have registered to do business in a U.S. state or tribal jurisdiction.
- All domestic entities (corporations, LLCs, etc. formed in the U.S.) are **exempt** from BOI reporting.
- All U.S. beneficial owners of domestic entities are **exempt**.

**Current Filing Obligations:**

| Entity Type | Obligation |
|-------------|------------|
| U.S. companies (domestic) | **EXEMPT** -- no BOI filing required |
| U.S. persons (as beneficial owners) | **EXEMPT** |
| Foreign entities registered in U.S. before March 26, 2025 | Must file BOI report by **April 25, 2025** |
| Foreign entities registered in U.S. on or after March 26, 2025 | Must file within **30 calendar days** of registration |

**Enforcement Posture:** FinCEN will NOT enforce BOI penalties or fines against U.S. companies, U.S. persons, or domestic reporting companies.

**Note for Financial Institutions:** The CDD Rule (31 CFR 1010.230) requiring beneficial ownership collection at account opening is **separate** from the CTA's BOI reporting to FinCEN. Financial institutions must STILL collect beneficial ownership from legal entity customers under the CDD Rule regardless of the CTA exemption.

## 2.8 AML Act of 2020 -- Implementation Status

### 2.8.1 Overview

The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AMLA), enacted January 1, 2021 as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, is the most comprehensive reform of U.S. AML law since the USA PATRIOT Act.

### 2.8.2 Key Provisions and Implementation Status (as of February 2026)

| Provision | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **AML/CFT National Priorities** | Published June 30, 2021 | Must be updated every 4 years. Eight priorities: corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking, proliferation financing. |
| **AML/CFT Program Modernization** | Proposed rule June 2024 (89 FR 55075) | Would require programs to be "effective, risk-based, and reasonably designed." Includes mandatory risk assessment incorporating National Priorities. NOT yet finalized as of Feb 2026. |
| **Beneficial Ownership (CTA)** | Partially implemented, then scaled back | Domestic entities exempted March 2025 (see Section 2.6). |
| **BSA Whistleblower Program** | Enhanced | Modernized whistleblower protections and incentives (codified at 31 U.S.C. 5323). |
| **Investment Adviser AML Rule** | Effective date delayed to Jan 1, 2028 | FinCEN final rule (Jan 2, 2026) postponed covered IA obligations from Jan 1, 2026 to Jan 1, 2028. FinCEN intends to revisit the substance of the rule. |
| **SAR/CTR Modernization** | In progress | FinCEN reviewing filing processes. October 2025 SAR FAQ issued. |
| **Data Feedback Loops** | In progress | FinCEN developing mechanisms to provide feedback to filers on usefulness of BSA reports. |

### 2.8.3 FinCEN's AML/CFT National Priorities (2021, updated at least every 4 years)

1. **Corruption** -- foreign and domestic public corruption
2. **Cybercrime** -- including ransomware and cyber-enabled financial crime
3. **Domestic and International Terrorist Financing**
4. **Fraud** -- including bank fraud, healthcare fraud, tax fraud, securities fraud
5. **Transnational Criminal Organizations**
6. **Drug Trafficking Organizations**
7. **Human Trafficking and Human Smuggling**
8. **Proliferation Financing** -- WMD-related

Financial institutions should incorporate these priorities into their risk assessments and AML/CFT programs.
