## 1.2 Examination Frequency and Scope

### Statutory Requirements (12 USC 1820(d))

**Full-scope, on-site examinations** are required every 12 to 18 months for all banks.

| Institution Type | Safety & Soundness Exam Cycle | Compliance Exam Cycle |
|-----------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Banks rated CAMELS 1 or 2, assets <$3B** | Every 18 months | See FDIC schedule below |
| **All other banks** | Every 12 months | Annually or as scheduled |
| **Large banks (>$10B assets)** | Continuous supervision (OCC/Fed) | Annual CFPB supervision cycle |
| **Problem banks (CAMELS 3-5)** | More frequent; may be continuous | Heightened schedule |

### 2025-2026 Updates to Exam Frequency

**OCC Bulletin 2025-24** (effective January 1, 2026):
- The OCC is **removing all fixed examination activity requirements** for community banks set by OCC policy (not required by statute).
- Examiners will tailor examination scope based on each bank's **size, complexity, and risk profile**.
- Heightened focus on **material financial risks** rather than process checklists.
- Source: [OCC Bulletin 2025-24](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2025/bulletin-2025-24.html)

**FDIC Consumer Compliance Exam Schedule** (updated 2025):
- Banks with **<$350M assets**: Compliance exam approximately once every **6 years** with midcycle review (66-78 month cycle).
- Banks with **$350M-$3B assets**: Compliance exam approximately once every **5 years** with midcycle review (54-66 month cycle).
- Banks with **>$3B assets**: More frequent cycle (24-36 months).

## 1.3 CAMELS Rating System

**Authority:** FFIEC Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (adopted 1979, revised 1996)
**Citation:** [Federal Reserve SR 96-38](https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/srletters/1996/sr9638.htm); [FDIC FIL-96-105](https://www.fdic.gov/news/financial-institution-letters/1996/fil96105.html)

Composite and component ratings are assigned on a scale of **1 (strongest) to 5 (weakest)**.

### Component Breakdown

| Component | What Examiners Evaluate |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **C -- Capital Adequacy** | Risk-based capital ratios (CET1, Tier 1, Total Capital); leverage ratio; capital planning and stress testing; adequacy of allowance for credit losses; ability to raise capital |
| **A -- Asset Quality** | Loan portfolio quality; classified and criticized assets; concentration risk; adequacy of underwriting standards; ALLL/ACL methodology; nonperforming asset trends; credit administration practices |
| **M -- Management** | Board and senior management oversight; risk management frameworks; strategic planning; internal controls; audit function; compliance management system (CMS); succession planning |
| **E -- Earnings** | Level, trend, and stability of earnings; net interest margin; noninterest income; efficiency ratio; quality and sources of earnings; budgeting and forecasting |
| **L -- Liquidity** | Funding sources and stability; liquidity risk management; contingency funding plan; reliance on wholesale/brokered funding; on- and off-balance sheet liquidity |
| **S -- Sensitivity to Market Risk** | Interest rate risk management; market risk exposure; economic value of equity (EVE) analysis; earnings-at-risk modeling; adequacy of risk limits |

### 2025 Update
The FDIC is actively working with other FFIEC members to **reevaluate CAMELS rating definitions**, with a goal to emphasize core financial risks while shifting away from overemphasis on process-related issues. Source: [FDIC Statement at FSOC Meeting (Dec 2025)](https://www.fdic.gov/statement-december-2025-fsoc-meeting.pdf)

### Composite Rating
The composite CAMELS rating is **NOT an arithmetic average** of the components. The weight given to any component depends on the degree of supervisory concern associated with that particular area.

## 1.5 Common Examination Findings and Deficiencies

Per the [OCC Semiannual Risk Perspective (Fall 2025)](https://www.occ.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/semiannual-risk-perspective/files/pub-semiannual-risk-perspective-fall-2025.pdf) and historical enforcement data:

### Safety and Soundness
- Excessive risk-taking and rapid growth without commensurate risk controls
- Deficient underwriting and credit administration
- Excessive asset or liability concentrations (especially in CRE)
- Weak risk management frameworks
- Dominant influence by a single officer or director without adequate checks
- Inadequate allowance for credit losses methodology
- Cybersecurity weaknesses and technology risk management gaps
- Third-party risk management deficiencies

### Compliance
- BSA/AML program deficiencies (inadequate risk assessment, insufficient SAR filing, weak CDD)

- HMDA data accuracy errors
- Incomplete adverse action notices
- Flood insurance violations
- Truth in Lending Act (TILA) disclosure errors
- RESPA/TRID violations

Per the [OCC Semiannual Risk Perspective](https://occ.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/semiannual-risk-perspective/index-semiannual-risk-perspective.html):
1. **Credit risk** -- CRE concentrations, weakening credit quality in certain portfolios
2. **Market risk** -- Interest rate risk, unrealized losses in securities portfolios
3. **Operational risk** -- Cybersecurity threats (elevated), third-party dependencies, fraud
4. **Compliance risk** -- BSA/AML, consumer protection, fair lending

## 1.6 CFPB Supervision Process

**Authority:** Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Title X (12 USC 5511 et seq.)

### Who the CFPB Supervises
- Depository institutions with **>$10 billion in total assets** (and their affiliates)
- Certain **nonbank entities**: mortgage companies (originators, servicers, brokers), payday lenders, private student lenders, and larger participants in other consumer financial markets

### How CFPB Exams Differ from OCC/FDIC
| Feature | CFPB | OCC/FDIC |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Focus** | Consumer protection and fair lending only | Full safety and soundness + compliance |
| **Scope** | Federal consumer financial laws | All applicable banking laws and regulations |
| **Approach** | Risk-based prioritization; targeted reviews | Full-scope and targeted exams |
| **Exam types** | Prioritized assessments, supervisory exams, targeted reviews | Full-scope safety & soundness, compliance, specialty exams |
| **Nonbank authority** | Yes (mortgage, payday, student lending, larger participants) | No (banking institutions only) |
| **Enforcement** | Can bring enforcement independently | Coordinate with state regulators |

### Compliance Management System (CMS) -- Core of CFPB Exams
The CFPB evaluates an institution's CMS, which consists of:
1. **Board and management oversight** -- Commitment to compliance, resource allocation
2. **Compliance program** -- Policies, procedures, training, monitoring, corrective action
3. **Consumer complaint management** -- Intake, investigation, resolution, trend analysis
4. **Compliance audit** -- Independent review of compliance program effectiveness

### 2025-2026 CFPB Examination Changes
Per the [CFPB Supervision & Examinations page](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/compliance/supervision-examinations/) and the November 2025 [Examiner Humility Pledge](https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_examiner-humility-pledge_2025-11.pdf):

- **Greater transparency** regarding exam process and expectations
- **Advance notice** of scheduled examinations
- **Narrower scope** -- Requests will focus on Bureau priorities and stay within defined exam scope
- **Focus on pattern-and-practice violations** with tangible, identifiable consumer harm
- **Avoidance of duplication** where states or other regulators already supervise
- **Humility Pledge** -- Examiners instructed to be respectful, transparent, and proportionate
- **Priority markets** consistent with April 2025 Memorandum on Supervision and Enforcement Priorities, with special focus on servicemembers, their families, and veterans

**Key principle:** Regulation B applies to **ALL credit** -- commercial and personal -- without regard to the nature or type of credit or the creditor. It applies to **all methods** of credit evaluation, whether judgmental or automated/algorithmic.

**2025 Change:** On May 12, 2025, the CFPB **withdrew** its 2021 interpretive rule that extended the sex discrimination prohibition to encompass sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination. Additionally, the CFPB proposed amendments to Regulation B provisions pertaining to disparate impact (see Section 2.5 below).

### Adverse Action Notice Requirements (12 CFR 1002.9)

**Citation:** [12 CFR 1002.9](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-X/part-1002/subpart-A/section-1002.9)

- Creditors **cannot** use boilerplate or generic reasons when using AI/ML models
- The reasons must be **specific and accurate** to the applicant's situation
- Using a model that cannot produce specific reasons does **NOT** excuse noncompliance
- "Internal standards or policies" or "failed to achieve a qualifying score" are **insufficient**

### Record Retention (12 CFR 1002.12)

**Citation:** [12 CFR 1002.12](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-X/part-1002/subpart-A/section-1002.12)

### Purpose
CRA requires federal banking regulators to encourage financial institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they do business, including low- and moderate-income (LMI) neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations.

### CRA Modernization Rule -- Critical 2024-2026 Status

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| **Oct. 24, 2023** | OCC, Fed, FDIC issue joint final rule to modernize CRA regulations |
| **Feb. 1, 2024** | 2023 Final Rule published in Federal Register |
| **Mar. 29, 2024** | Federal court issues **preliminary injunction** staying the rule's implementation |
| **Mar. 28, 2025** | Agencies announce intent to **rescind** the 2023 Final Rule ([OCC NR 2025-26](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2025/nr-ia-2025-26.html)) |
| **Jul. 16, 2025** | Agencies issue joint **NPRM to rescind** 2023 Final Rule and replace with regulations **substantively identical to 1995/2021 rules** ([OCC Bulletin 2025-18](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2025/bulletin-2025-18.html)) |
| **Current (2026)** | **The 2023 modernization rule NEVER took effect.** Agencies continue evaluating CRA performance under the **1995/2021 regulatory framework.** |

Source: [OCC Bulletin 2025-5: Rescinding the 2023 CRA Final Rule](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2025/bulletin-2025-5.html)

### Currently Effective CRA Framework (1995/2021 Rules)

#### Assessment Areas (12 CFR 25.41 / 228.41 / 345.41)
Banks must delineate one or more assessment areas consisting of one or more MSAs or metropolitan divisions, or one or more contiguous political subdivisions (counties, cities, towns). Assessment areas must:
- Include the geographies where the bank has its main office, branches, and deposit-taking ATMs
- Include surrounding geographies where the bank has originated or purchased a substantial portion of its loans
- Consist of whole geographies (generally census tracts)
- Not reflect illegal discrimination or arbitrarily exclude LMI geographies

#### Performance Tests

**Large Banks (assets >$1.564B as of 2025):** Evaluated under three tests:

| Test | Weight | What Is Evaluated | Key Metrics |
|------|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Lending Test** (12 CFR 25.22) | Most weight | Distribution of loans among geographies and borrowers of different income levels; community development lending | Home mortgage, small business, small farm, community development loans; geographic and borrower distribution |
| **Investment Test** (12 CFR 25.23) | Significant | Qualified investments that benefit the assessment area | Dollar amount, innovativeness, responsiveness of community development investments |
| **Service Test** (12 CFR 25.24) | Considered | Accessibility of delivery systems; record of opening/closing branches; community development services | Branch distribution in LMI areas; services tailored to LMI needs; community development services hours |

**Small Banks (assets <$391M as of 2025):** Evaluated primarily under a **streamlined lending test** focusing on loan-to-deposit ratio, percentage of lending in assessment area, geographic and borrower distribution, and responsiveness to complaints.

**Intermediate Small Banks ($391M-$1.564B):** Evaluated under the small bank lending test PLUS a **community development test**.

#### CRA Ratings
- **Outstanding**
- **Satisfactory**
- **Needs to Improve**
- **Substantial Noncompliance**

CRA ratings are **public** and must be included in the bank's CRA public file. Poor CRA ratings can result in denial of applications for mergers, acquisitions, or branch openings.

## 2.5 Disparate Impact vs. Disparate Treatment

### Definitions

**Disparate Treatment:**
A creditor treats a credit applicant **differently** based on a prohibited basis (race, sex, etc.). Does NOT require showing that the treatment was motivated by prejudice or conscious intent to discriminate. May be proved by:
- Overt evidence of discrimination (statements, policies)
- Comparative evidence (similarly situated applicants treated differently)
- Statistical evidence of systematic differences

**Disparate Impact:**
A facially neutral policy or practice has a **disproportionately negative effect** on a protected class, even without discriminatory intent. Under the traditional three-part burden-shifting framework:
1. Plaintiff shows the policy causes a disparate impact on a protected class
2. Defendant shows the policy serves a legitimate business necessity
3. Plaintiff shows a less discriminatory alternative exists

### CRITICAL 2025 Change: Executive Order 14281

**On April 23, 2025**, President Trump issued **Executive Order 14281** ("Restoring Equality of Opportunity and Meritocracy"), which directs federal agencies to **eliminate the use of disparate impact liability in all contexts** to the maximum degree possible.

**Agency actions in response:**

| **OCC** | Removed all disparate impact references from "Fair Lending" booklet of Comptroller's Handbook; instructed examiners to cease examining for disparate impact | July 14, 2025 | [OCC Bulletin 2025-16](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2025/bulletin-2025-16.html) |
| **FDIC** | Updated Consumer Compliance Examination Manual to remove all disparate impact references; will evaluate only through disparate treatment | August 29, 2025 | [FDIC FIL Update](https://www.fdic.gov/news/financial-institution-letters/2025/update-fdics-consumer-compliance-examination-manual) |
| **NCUA** | Removed disparate impact references from Fair Lending Guide | 2025 | [NCUA Press Release](https://ncua.gov/newsroom/press-release/2025/ncua-disparate-impact-references-fair-lending-guide-and-other-materials) |
| **CFPB** | Proposed amendments to Regulation B provisions pertaining to disparate impact | 2025 NPRM | [CFPB Reg B NPRM](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/notice-opportunities-comment/open-notices/equal-credit-opportunity-act-regulation-b/) |

**Important Legal Nuance:** EO 14281 eliminates **federal enforcement** of disparate impact but does **NOT** invalidate the legal doctrine itself. The Supreme Court upheld disparate impact liability under the Fair Housing Act in *Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project* (2015). State attorneys general, private litigants, and state regulators may still pursue disparate impact claims.

### Practical Implications for a Fair Lending Tool
- Federal examiners will focus exclusively on **disparate treatment** analysis
- Institutions should still monitor for disparate impact as a **risk management best practice** (state regulators, private lawsuits, reputational risk)
- Tool should clearly distinguish between disparate treatment analysis and disparate impact analysis, allowing users to run both

**CFPB Circular 2022-03** (Still in Effect as of 2026):
- Creditors using AI/ML must provide **specific and accurate adverse action reasons**
- Cannot use boilerplate; must reflect actual reason for denial
- Using an opaque model is **not an excuse** for noncompliance with Regulation B
- Source: [CFPB Circular 2022-03](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/compliance/circulars/circular-2022-03-adverse-action-notification-requirements-in-connection-with-credit-decisions-based-on-complex-algorithms/)

**CFPB Innovation Spotlight on AI/ML Adverse Action Notices:**
