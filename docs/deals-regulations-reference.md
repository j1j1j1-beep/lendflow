## 2. Transaction Structures

### Stock/Equity Purchase

- **Tax**: Seller pays capital gains on stock gain. Buyer gets carryover basis in assets (no step-up). Entity tax attributes (NOLs, credits) transfer but subject to Section 382 limitations.
- **Liability**: ALL liabilities transfer (known and unknown) — buyer assumes everything
- **Contracts**: Assignment provisions in contracts may require consent
- **Most common** for PE acquisitions of private companies

### Asset Purchase
- Buyer acquires specific assets and assumes specified liabilities
- **Tax**: Seller recognizes gain on each asset sold (ordinary vs capital). Buyer gets stepped-up basis in acquired assets. Purchase price allocated per **Section 1060** (residual method).
- **Liability**: Only assumed liabilities transfer. Successor liability risk in some states.
- **Contracts**: Must be individually assigned (consent often required)
- **Preferred** when buyer wants to cherry-pick assets/liabilities

### Section 338(h)(10) Election
- Treats stock purchase as deemed asset purchase for **tax purposes only**
- Available only for S corps and subsidiaries of consolidated groups

### Section 338(g) Election

### Mergers (Section 368 Reorganizations)

| Type B (§368(a)(1)(B)) | Stock-for-stock — buyer exchanges solely its voting stock for target stock | Must be 100% voting stock; no boot (cash) allowed |
| Type C (§368(a)(1)(C)) | Stock-for-assets — buyer acquires substantially all target assets for voting stock | Max 20% boot; target must liquidate |
| Forward triangular | Target merges into buyer's subsidiary | Substantially all of target's assets must be acquired |
| Reverse triangular | Buyer's subsidiary merges into target (target survives) | Must acquire 80% of target stock; target must hold substantially all assets |

### Tender Offer
